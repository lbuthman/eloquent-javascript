1. Only one type not equal to itself: NaN == NaN --> false.

2. Urnary operators operate on one value vs. binary operator operating on two values. Ternary operators are like
    shorthand if then statement (true) ? : a, b;

3. The || operator allows a default value if the first value evaluates to false (a || b), using the second
    statement if the first one isn't true. The && operator throws the second one away if not true. These are
    called short circuit operations since the right side might never be evaluated.
