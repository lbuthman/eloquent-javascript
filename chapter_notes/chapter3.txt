1. Don't define a new function inside a conditional expression. Why would anyone though???

2. Extra function arguments are just ignored, allowing flexibility and danger.

3. A function that "closes over" some local variables is called a closure.

4. TODO - Play with closure example

5. A mental model for closures is "freezing" the code body.

6. Speed vs. elegance - (assertion): any program can be made faster by making it bigger more convoluted.

7. "The basic rule is to not worry about efficiency until the program is slow."

8. TODO - Review recursion example.

9. Functions defined in other functions have access to the outer functions local scope.
